- TODO: maybe we can introduce Arc<Settings> in the future when we add dynamic settings
- TODO: implement http2::builder instead of http1
- TODO: should we listen to siguser1 or siguser2 to do things like resetting the config? or should we just use sighup for that?
- TODO: since i'm explicitly listening for sigint sigterm etc, am i unintentionally overriding existing graceful shutdown mechanisms for other libraries such as hyperim or tracing?
- TODO: look into whether the req/res Bytes conversions are necessary, especially right after serialization
- TODO: what's a good naming convention for spans? plain english? snake case?
- TODO: consider using CompactString instead of regular strings for configs
- TODO: in broadcast channels, use Arc<str> instead of Arc<String> to avoid unnecessary cloning
  (Broadcasting a payload will `Clone` it each and every single time.)
- TODO: look into DashSets instead of HashSets for performant concurrent hash sets. keys are shared into lock groups, so if 2 unrelated locks come into the same hashset, they won't block for no reason.
- TODO: System allocator -> jemalloc (jemalloc is suppose to be faster for multithreaded programs because it uses per-thread arenas which reduces contention for memory allocation. That sounds good to me, so let's change our allocator to jemalloc.) (https://arc.net/l/quote/yxriimmz)
